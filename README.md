# Coding-Practice
---
### Reason for this and Why it might be messy
Repo to push my practice code so I don't lose my skills. This is just a general repo for any short and fun coding projects that I do. This can range from doing a fun C project about web servers to a project in Python using pytorch for creating a simple model. Any other major projects will have their own repo. This is just for fun cause coding is fun-ish.
